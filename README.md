## Introduction
You are not required to modify anything in the program files.  
These instructions do NOT apply for Windows. They are intended for Unix-based systems like macOS and Linux.

## Opening the Terminal
Open your terminal of preference, preferably the VSCode integrated terminal with:  
<span class="keyboard-shortcut"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd></span>

## Compiling the Code
Type `make` to compile the library and gain access to the fully compiled executable called `main`.

## Running Test Cases
We have a directory called `catalogues`, containing different sizes of test cases. You can run them by typing `./main <desired test case's relative path>`.

## Cleaning Up
Don't forget to run `make clean` after you are done using the code. Feel free to alter the `main` file and make use of our different available methods as you wish.

## Visualizing the Assignments
The `make vis` command is set to execute the assignment description graph. You can change it to any other test case in the Makefile (note that large test cases might not work well with graph visualization).

## Output Image
The default `make vis` command should output this image:
